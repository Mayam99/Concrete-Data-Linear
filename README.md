# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction

Predicting Strength Using Linear Regression

This project analyzes a concrete compressive strength dataset from Kaggle to build a predictive linear regression model. The goal is to identify key factors (e.g., cement content, water ratio, curing time) that influence concrete strength, enabling optimized mix designs for construction applications.

# Project Overview

* Dataset: Concrete Compressive Strength Data (1030 samples, 9 features).

* Objective: Develop a linear regression model to predict compressive strength (MPa) based on material proportions and curing age.

* Key Steps:

 - Data cleaning (handled 25 duplicate entries).

 - Exploratory analysis (correlations, feature distributions).

 - Linear regression modeling with scikit-learn.

 - Evaluation using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

# Key Insights

* Most influential features: Cement content (+ effect), water-cement ratio (- effect).

* Model Performance: Achieved an R² score of X.XX (explaining XX% of variance).

# Tools Used
* Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

* Machine Learning (scikit-learn)

* Data Preprocessing (StandardScaler, train_test_split)
